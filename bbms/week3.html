        <h2>History of Interaction</h2>
        
        <p>Dourish defines tangible computing as computing that agrees with and reflects our experiences as people who exist in bodies– we interact with things physically. Social computing is the idea that we relate to the world as social beings, and place social concepts on the computing systems we work with. Both are situated by the concept of embodied interaction, or interaction that notices and plays with the fact that it exists in a real space and does not just live in a singular interface. I think these concepts make sense, they were defined almost 20 years ago and I can find many examples just in Apple (the whole idea of an Apple ecosystem where devices work with each other and talk to each other) that reflect these ideas of interaction. 
        </p>

        <p>I’m not sure what other kinds of computing Dourish might be ignoring. Emotional computing? That’s social. Cognitive computing? That’s just computing computing. Queer computing? Social. Non western computing? Maybe, I wouldn’t know what that looks like. Religious computing. Maybe we can find a god somewhere between our hardware and software.
