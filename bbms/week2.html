       <p>This is my first time working on a breadboard and it went so well! I'm pretty happy with how quickly I got the hang of it. It's very exciting to work with little circuits as it is such a weird kind of tactile learning in plugging in wires and little things.</p>

       <p>After getting it to work with the basics, I replaced the fixed resitor with a photocell for more inputs.</p>

      <p>From there, I soldered it onto the bus board. This is my first time soldering anything electrical (I experimented in jewelry) and had some difficulty getting it started. 
        With some practice, I was able to get a nice, flat board by the end of it. Little components keep breaking when I try to put it in a container, so it doesn't work inside yet.

        I need to fix the speaker and add some hot glue to make it secure, but otherwise I'm so happy with it!
