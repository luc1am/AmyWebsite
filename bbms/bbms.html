        <h2>What exactly is interactivity?</h2>
        
        <p>I would describe interactivity as communication with information processing between people or systems. 
            The word communication is difficult because it doesn’t necessarily mean that things are understood, 
            processed, or information is used in some way for the response. I really enjoy Crawford’s definition 
            of interaction precisely because it expresses it in a people forward matter rather than using technically 
            specific jargon that requires an analogy to understand, it goes straight to using real human experiences
             as the basis for the definition. <br><br> I think it is important to have different ways of understanding
              how things work to bring in opportunities for diverse backgrounds to understand a system or problem.
               At IDM, I always find myself halfway between art and technology, of course, and jargon can be such a
                limiting way of isolating certain people from having access to a technology or even theory. Many 
                times, I find myself asking a friend for a “dumbed down” version of what is happening on a website, 
                and understanding these things usually come with a certain level of familiarity with a topic, but 
                just sets up another barrier for my access to these things. For example, I am trying to figure out
                 how to manufacture a PCB, which is something very new to me, and circular definitions provide no 
                 understanding for what is going on and how to move forward, even through the ordering process. In
                  providing multiple definitions and opportunities for accessible interaction, more people from
                   different backgrounds are able to understand, and form their own understanding of the purpose of
                    a system or technology, subverting its expectations.
